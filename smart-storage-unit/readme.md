# Smart Storage Unit Example

## Introduction
This guide will walk you through the process of building contracts for a Smart Storage Unit, deploying them into an existing world running, and testing their functionality by executing scripts.

A Smart Storage Unit can be configured to automatically to trade items between the owner and other players. Exchange quantity are set by providing a ratio of items. For example with a ratio of 1:2 you can exchange, 1 ore for 2 mining crystals.

You can use [Deployment and Testing in Local](#Local) to test the example locally on your computer and [Deployment to Stillness](#Stillness) to deploy it to the game.

### Additional Information

For additional information on the Smart Storage Unit you can visit: [https://docs.evefrontier.com/SmartAssemblies/SmartStorageUnit](https://docs.evefrontier.com/SmartAssemblies/SmartStorageUnit).

## Deployment and Testing in Local<a id='Local'></a>
### Step 0: Deploy the example contracts to the existing world
First, copy the World Contract Address from the Docker logs obtained in the previous step, then run the following commands:

![alt text](../readme-imgs/docker-deployment.png)

Move to the example directory with:

```bash
cd smart-storage-unit
```

Then install the Solidity dependencies for the contracts:
```bash
pnpm install
```

This will deploy the contracts to a forked version of your local world for testing.
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### Step 1: Setup the environment variables 
Next, replace the following values in the [.env](./packages/contracts/.env) file with the below steps.

A ratio with the in being 1 and out being 2 means that for every item a player puts into the deployable, they get two items from it. 

You can alter this ratio how you want, but be careful not to accidentally give away your whole supply of items with the wrong ratio.

```bash
#IN Ratio
IN_RATIO=1
#OUT Ratio
OUT_RATIO=2
```

### Step 2: Mock data for the existing world **(Local Development Only)**
Click on the "shell" process and then click on the main terminal window. 

To generate mock data for testing the Vending Machine logic on the local world, run the following command. This generates and deploys the smart storage deployable and items.

![Processes Image](../readme-imgs/processes.png)

```bash
pnpm mock-data
```

This will create the on-chain SSU, fuel it and bring it online.

### Step 3: Configure SSU
To configure which items should be traded and the ratio's to trade for run:

```bash
pnpm configure
```

You can adjust the values for the SSU_ID, in and out item ID's and the ratios in the .env file as needed, though they are optional.

### Step 4: Test The SSU (Optional)
To test the SSU, execute the following command:

```bash
pnpm execute
```


## Deployment to Stillness<a id='Stillness'></a>
### Step 0: Deploy the example contracts to Stillness
Move to the example directory with:

```bash
cd smart-storage-unit/packages/contracts
```

Then install the Solidity dependencies for the contracts:
```bash
pnpm install
```

Next, convert the [.env](./packages/contracts/.env) **WORLD_ADDRESS** and **RPC_URL** value to point to Stillness using: 

```bash
pnpm env-stillness
```

Change the namespace from test to your own custom namespace. This will be the namespace that you use for future development with the Item Seller or other smart contracts. For example, you could use your username as the namespace. Once you deploy to a namespace, it will set you as the owner and only you will be able to deploy smart contracts within the namespace. Namespaces can only contain a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and _.

Use this command and then input your new namespace to change it:

```bash
pnpm set-namespace
```

Now replace the private key in the [.env](./packages/contracts/.env) file. Get your recovery phrase from the game wallet, import into EVE Wallet and then retrieve the private key as visible in the image below.

![Private Key](../readme-imgs/private-key.png)

```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
```

Then deploy the contract using:

```bash
pnpm run deploy:garnet
```

Once the deployment is successful, you'll see a screen similar to the one below. This process deploys the SSU contract. 

![alt text](../readme-imgs/deploy.png)

### Step 1: Setup the environment variables 
Next, replace the following values in the [.env](./packages/contracts/.env) file with the below steps.

Now set the test player private key. This will be used for the execute script, and so set it to the private key of the player account that you want to trade with. You can also skip this variable for now if you want.

- Note: This is only for testing, and an example not requiring this is on it's way.

```bash
TEST_PLAYER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
```

For Stillness, the Smart Storage Unit ID (SSU ID) is available once you have deployed an SSU in the game.

Right click your Smart Storage Unit, and open the DApp window and copy the smart storage unit id.

![alt text](../readme-imgs/ssu-id.png)

```bash
#DONT NEED TO CHANGE IF YOUR RUNNING LOCALLY
SSU_ID=34818344039668088032259299209624217066809194721387714788472158182502870248994
```

To get the Item ID's you can use https://blockchain-gateway-stillness.live.tech.evefrontier.com/types and then search for the item name.

You can use the "smartItemId" as the Item ID below.

```json
"83839": {
        "name": "Salt",
        "description": "Computational Salt is a crystalline substance primarily used in exotronic computing. It is one of the products of Crude Matter industry. The larger the crystal, the more massive models for computation it can contain, but we are still talking about microscopic sizes invisible to the naked human eye.",
        "smartItemId": "70505200487489129491533272716910408603753256595363780714882065332876101173161",
        "attributes": [
            {
                "trait_type": "typeID",
                "value": 83839
            },
            ...
        ]
}
```

```bash
#ITEM IN : SALT
ITEM_IN_ID=70505200487489129491533272716910408603753256595363780714882065332876101173161
#ITEM OUT : LENS
ITEM_OUT_ID=112603025077760770783264636189502217226733230421932850697496331082050661822826
```

A ratio with the in being 1 and out being 2 means that for every item a player puts into the deployable, they get two items from it. 

You can alter this ratio how you want, but be careful not to accidentally give away your whole supply of items with the wrong ratio.

```bash
#IN Ratio
IN_RATIO=1
#OUT Ratio
OUT_RATIO=2
```

### Step 2: Configure SSU
To configure which items should be traded and the ratio's to trade for run:

```bash
pnpm configure
```

You can adjust the values for the SSU_ID, in and out item ID's and the ratios in the .env file as needed, though they are optional.

### Step 3: Execute the trade
To trade items, make sure the items are in the inventories and then you need to run:

```bash
pnpm execute
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, refer to the troubleshooting tips below:

1. **World Address Mismatch**: Double-check that the `WORLD_ADDRESS` is correctly updated in the `contracts/.env` file. Make sure you are deploying contracts to the correct world.
   
2. **Anvil Instance Conflicts**: Ensure there is only one running instance of Anvil. The active instance should be initiated via the `docker compose up -d` command. Multiple instances of Anvil may cause unexpected behavior or deployment errors.

3. **Trade Quantity Is Incorrect**: Ensure your input and output ratios have been correctly set in the `contracts/.env` file.
